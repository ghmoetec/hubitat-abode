# Abode Alarm driver for Hubitat

Allows retrieving status and changing the mode of an Abode Alarm system.

## Inspired by

* Hubitat example driver code from https://github.com/hubitat/HubitatPublic/tree/master/examples/drivers
* AbodePy by https://github.com/MisterWil/abodepy

## Warranty

I certify that this code is not suitable for any purpose.
If you are foolish enough to install it, **gremlins will eat everything you love**.
*Don't say I didn't tell you.*

I'm associated with neither Hubitat nor Abode in any way other than being a customer of theirs.
They've likely never seen this driver, and should warn you not to install it if they did.

## Installation

Follow Hubitat's instructions for adding new driver code: 
  [https://docs.hubitat.com/index.php?title=How_to_Install_Custom_Drivers](https://docs.hubitat.com/index.php?title=How_to_Install_Custom_Drivers)

Import the driver from following URL:
  [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorhett/hubitat-abode/master/AbodeAlarm.groovy](https://github.com/jorhett/hubitat-abode/blob/master/AbodeAlarm.groovy)

Weep, because **you were warned and didn't listen**.
