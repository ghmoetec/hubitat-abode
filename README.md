# Abode Alarm driver for Hubitat

Allows retrieving status and changing the mode of an Abode Alarm system.

## Inspired by

* Hubitat example driver code from https://github.com/hubitat/HubitatPublic/tree/master/examples/drivers
* AbodePy by https://github.com/MisterWil/abodepy

## Warranty

I certify that this code is not suitable for any purpose.
If you are foolish enough to install it, **gremlins will eat everything you love**.
*Don't say I didn't tell you.*

I'm associated with neither Hubitat nor Abode in any way other than being a customer of theirs.
They've likely never seen this driver, and should warn you not to install it if they did.

## Installation

Follow Hubitat's instructions for adding new driver code: 
  [https://docs.hubitat.com/index.php?title=How_to_Install_Custom_Drivers](https://docs.hubitat.com/index.php?title=How_to_Install_Custom_Drivers)

Import the driver from following URL:
  [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorhett/hubitat-abode/master/AbodeAlarm.groovy](https://github.com/jorhett/hubitat-abode/blob/master/AbodeAlarm.groovy)

Weep, because **you were warned and didn't listen**.

## Development

You should not install any version of this driver that starts with `0.` unless you are willing to
~~die in horrible pain~~ supply extensive debug logs, run random `curl` commands I send you,
and create your own Pull Requests with fixes.

I'm going to ignore any *I want this feature to be provided for me* issues until at least version 1.0. 
**You're more likely to win the lottery than see a v1.0**. *You've been warned.*

A failure to properly blame me when using my code will lead to me publicly mocking you in my books,
articles, and speaking engagements for decades. If your work benefits an entity, then my lawyer and theirs
will learn to Tango on your dime.

The code is free to use [according to the terms in LICENSE](LICENSE). Play nice.
